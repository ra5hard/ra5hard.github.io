## Proposition 64: The Adult Use of Marijuana Act
Overview [The California Cannabis Hemp Initiative of 2014](https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/2014/140072.aspx)
Effective November 9, 2016, Proposition 64 legalizes specified personal use and cultivation of marijuana for adults 21 years of age or older; reduces criminal penalties for specified marijuana-related offenses for adults and juveniles; and authorizes resentencing or dismissal and sealing of prior, eligible marijuana-related convictions. The proposition includes provisions on regulation, licensing, and taxation of legalized use.

## [Here’s who has been impacted by the AWS outage ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5564082-aws-outage-lyft-fortnite-coinbase-peloton-roblox-amazon/)

Here's the timeline [Tom's Hardwaretomshw.it/](https://www.tomshw.it/) [git](https://github.com/tomshw)
At around 12:11am PDT (3:11am ET, 8:11am BST), AWS started experiencing outages. And as AWS is the backbone of most of the internet, it took out hundreds of websites and services with it.
We started seeing huge spikes in outage reports for apps like Snapchat, Venmo and Ring, Amazon services like Alexa, and games like Fornite and Pokémon GO.
At 1:26am PDT (4:26am ET, 9:26am BST), the issue was diagnosed as a big one related to the DynamoDB endpoint of AWS — the digital phonebook of the internet.
At 2:01am PDT (5:01am ET, 10:01am BST), the specific problem was identified and work on a fix began.
At 2:22am PDT (5:22am ET, 10:22am BST), the fix was deployed and since then, service has been slowly but surely returning to normal.
BUT THEN, Reddit went down, and AWS updated saying there is a backlog of issues to work through.
At 4:48am PDT (7:48am ET, 12:48pm BST), Amazon has found a fix but is still working on issues, as Ring and Chime are experiencing outages.
At 5:48am PDT (8:48 ET, 1:48pm BST), more fixes are being applied. But almost in an interesting game of whack-a-mole, Wordle is down, and Snapchat users are experiencing outages too. The AWS outage reports are slowly starting to creep up again.
At 9:15am PDT (11:15 am ET, 4:15pm BST) we started seeing a huge spike in reports for Venmo, a popular payment app. This came shortly after AWS said it was still investigating the root cause and identifying mitigations. It's still an issue and most definitely not resolved yet.
At 10:03am PDT 1:03 pm ET, 6:15pm BST) AWS posted some updates, but it didn't add much other than letting us know it's working on the problem. At 10:38 PDT, the compay said, "We are applying mitigations to the remaining AZs at which point we expect launch errors and network connectivity issues to subside."
At 12:15 p.m. PDT (3:15 ET, 8;15 BST) AWS posted some updates that the claimed services were starting to return with some intermittent function errors. We've also seen a slow but steady decrease in reports on Down Detector.
Between 1:00 pm PDT and 2:30 pm, AWS posted cautious updates about slowly reducing throttles as the company brought more features back online.
At 3:00 pm PDT (6 ET, 11 BST) AWS closed the issue listing as resolved and blaming it on a DNS issue and nin internal subsystem that didn't resolve after a DNS fix.
