**Do not launch**  if the sustained wind
at the 162-foot level of the launch
pad exceeds 30 mph.

**Do not launch**  through upper-level
conditions containing wind shear
that could lead to control problems
for the launch vehicle.

**Do not launch**  for 30 minutes
after lightning is observed within
10 nautical miles of the launch pad
or the flight path, unless specified
conditions can be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of an attached thunderstorm
anvil cloud, unless temperature and
time-associated distance criteria can
be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of a detached thunderstorm
anvil cloud.

**Do not launch**  within 3 nautical
miles of a thunderstorm debris
cloud, unless specific timeassociated distance criteria can
be met.

**Do not launch**  within 5 nautical
miles of disturbed weather
clouds that extend into freezing
temperatures and contain moderate
or greater precipitation, unless
specific time-associated distance
criteria can be met.

**Do not launch**  for 15 minutes if
field mill instrument readings within
five nautical miles of the launch pad
exceed +/- 1,500 volts per meter, or
+/- 1,000 volts per meter if specified
criteria can be met.

**Do not launch**  through a cloud
layer greater than 4,500 feet
thick that extends into freezing
temperatures, unless other specific
criteria can be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of cumulus clouds with
tops that extend into freezing
temperatures, unless specific
height-associated distance criteria
can be met.

**Do not launch**  within 10 nautical
miles of the edge of a thunderstorm
that is producing lightning within
30 minutes after the last lightning is
observed.

**Do not launch**  through cumulus
clouds formed as the result of or
directly attached to a smoke plume,
unless time-associated criteria can
be met.

**Do not launch**  if downrange
weather indicates violation of limits
at splashdown in case of Dragon
launch escape.

**Do not launch**  if downrange
weather shows high probability of
violating limits at splashdown in
case of Dragon launch escape.
Downrange weather is monitored
at more than 50 locations along
the ascent track along the North
American eastern seaboard and
across the North Atlantic.
Probability of violation is calculated
for each location including limit
conditions for wind, waves, lightning,
and precipitation
