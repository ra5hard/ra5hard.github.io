Los Angeles - Long Beach Harbors, CA
March 16, 2015 
In southern California, the combined ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach account for 33% of the nation’s containerized imports. In early March, a long-lasting labor dispute between the longshoremen’s union and shipowners came to an end, and the large backlog of waiting cargo ships was being slowly unloaded. The left image was acquired July 4, 2014 during normal operations: 14 ships are being unloaded, while 7 wait their turns near the facilities. The right image was acquired on March 8, 2015: 19 ships are moored at unloading docks, while 47 ships wait their turns. The images cover an area of 16.7 x 18.6 km, and are located at 33.7 degrees north, 118.2 degrees west.
