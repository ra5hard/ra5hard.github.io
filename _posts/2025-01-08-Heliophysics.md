Hinode explores the magnetic fields of the Sun to improve understanding of what powers the solar atmosphere and drives solar eruptions. Hinode’s Solar Optical Telescope is the first space-borne instrument to measure the strength and direction of the Sun’s magnetic field on the Sun’s surface, the photosphere.

### About the SOHO Mission
[SoHo](https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/freestuff/#VIEWER)

 
 
SOHO, the Solar & Heliospheric Observatory, is a project of international collaboration between ESA and NASA to study the Sun from its deep core to the outer corona and the solar wind.

SOHO was launched on December 2, 1995. The SOHO spacecraft was built in Europe by an industry team led by prime contractor Matra Marconi Space (now EADS Astrium) under overall management by ESA. The twelve instruments on board SOHO were provided by European and American scientists. Nine of the international instrument consortia are led by European Principal Investigators (PI's), three by PI's from the US. Large engineering teams and more than 200 co-investigators from many institutions supported the PI's in the development of the instruments and in the preparation of their operations and data analysis. NASA was responsible for the launch and is now responsible for mission operations. Large radio dishes around the world which form NASA's Deep Space Network are used for data downlink and commanding. Mission control is based at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.

### NASA’s Parker Solar Probe Discovers Natural Radio Emission in Venus’ Atmosphere
On a mission to “touch the Sun,” NASA's Parker Solar Probe became the first spacecraft to fly through the corona – the Sun’s upper atmosphere – in 2021,During a brief swing by Venus, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe detected a natural radio signal that revealed the spacecraft had flown through the planet’s upper atmosphere.

 NOTE: 
  Contact with STEREO-B was lost 2014-Oct-01. 

  After 22 months, contact was regained at 22:27 UTC on August 21, 2016, when 
  the Deep Space Network established a lock on STEREO-B for 2.4 hours. The
  trajectory here is updated to use that tracking data. 

  It has been determined the spacecraft is in an uncontrolled spin of 
  3 deg/second. 

  2023-Feb-08:
   There has been no contact or new tracking data since 2016, but an updated
   prediction was added to support a search effort.

  2017-Sep-20: 
   Fix did NOT occur. Last contact with the spacecraft was September 23, 2016.

  2016-Oct-14: 
   Another opportunity to potentially fix the spacecraft will not occur until 
   mid-2017. Once its computer is powered on there will be about two minutes 
   to upload the fix before STEREO-B enters failure mode again.

 BACKGROUND:
  STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) is the third mission in 
  NASA's Solar Terrestrial Probes program (STP). This two-year mission will use
  two nearly identical space-based observatories - one ahead of Earth in its 
  orbit, the other trailing behind - to provide stereoscopic measurements to 
  study the Sun and the nature of coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

 OBJECTIVES:
  * Understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejection (CME) 
     initiation.
  * Characterize the propagation of CMEs through the heliosphere.
  * Discover the mechanisms and sites of energetic particle acceleration in 
     the low corona and the interplanetary medium.
  * Improve the determination of the structure of the ambient solar wind. 
 SPACECRAFT:
  Launch (Delta II 7925-10L) = October 26, 2006 @ 1:53
  Mission end                = 2 year nominal mission after launch
  Dimensions                 = 1.14m x 1.22m (launch), 6.47m x 2.03m (deployed)
  Launch Mass                = 620 kg  (includes propellant)
  Power consumption          = 475 watts
  Data downlink              = 720 kilobits/sec
  Memory                     = 1 GB
  Attitude                   = control within 7", knowledge within 0.1"
 INSTRUMENTS (4 packages on each spacecraft):
  * Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)
  * STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) radio burst tracker
  * In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT)
  * PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) 
 ORBIT:
  STEREO-A and STEREO-B will be launched together, then separate. The Moon's 
  gravity will be used to redirect the observatories to their appropriate 
  orbits, something the launch vehicle alone is not able to do.
  For the first three months after launch, the two observatories will fly in 
  highly elliptical orbits extending from very close to Earth to just beyond 
  the Moon's orbit. STEREO Mission Operations personnel at APL will 
  synchronize spacecraft orbits so that about two months after launch they 
  encounter the Moon, at which time one of them is close enough to use the 
  Moon's gravity to redirect it to a position "ahead"/leading the Earth.
  Approximately one month later, the second observatory will encounter the 
  Moon again and be redirected to its orbit "behind"/trailing the Earth.
